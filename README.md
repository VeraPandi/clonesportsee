Go to this link and clone the back-end: https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard

Then, you need to install the dependencies.
Open the back-end folder. In the terminal, use the command:

```
yarn install
```

## 2. Launch the back-end

In the terminal, use the commands:

```
yarn
```

Then,

```
yarn dev
```

## 3. Install front-end and dependencies

Now, you need to get the front-end used in this project.
Clone this repository: https://github.com/VeraPandi/sportsee

Then, you need to install the dependencies.
Open the front-end folder. In the terminal, use the command:

## 5. Get back-end and front-end ports

The backend port is: http://localhost:3000

If you want to get a front-end port different from the back-end port, use the following commands in the terminal:

```
yarn start
```

Then,

```
y
```

## Use the app

Go to a user profile:

-  User profile page with ID number `18` : [User 18](http://localhost:3001/sportsee/user/18)
-  User profile page with ID number `12` : [User 12](http://localhost:3001/sportsee/user/12)

If you want to switch from one user to another, just change in the url: `user/18` , to `user/12`
